                        This project was intended to be a fun way to play around with the bevy game engine. My buddy
                        WolfenGames and I worked on this over the span of a day and crammed as many Tetris features
                        in
                        as we could in that time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Take Aways</h2>
                    <p>
                        Overall i was really happy with this. It may not have been the prettiest thing in the world
                        but
                        it worked, and I was really happy with how clean we managed to keep the code considering the
                        rushed nature of the project.
